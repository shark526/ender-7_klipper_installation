  - Check functionality of all endstops
  - Check homing
  - Check extruder operation(direction)
  - Perform PID tuning for heated bed and hotend
  - Check your extruder is able to extrude the instructed amount of filament 
    - Calibrate e-steps
    - Calibrate flow rate

### Set heater_bed temp check heat then turn off and check for cool down (safe operation)
  - > SET_HEATER_TEMPERATURE HEATER=heater_bed TARGET=30
  - > SET_HEATER_TEMPERATURE HEATER=heater_bed TARGET=0
  
### Set heater_bed temp check heat then turn off and check for cool down (safe operation)
  - > SET_HEATER_TEMPERATURE HEATER=extruder TARGET=50
  - > SET_HEATER_TEMPERATURE HEATER=extruder TARGET=0
  
### Check endstops operation (with BLTouch)
  - Disable motors
    - > M83
  - Manually move print head away from end stops to center
  - Manually lower print bed out of way
  
  - Check endstops status
    - > QUERY_ENDSTOPS
      - return: x:open y:open z:open
  - Manually press and hold each endstop switch (X,Y) and check operation
    - > QUERY_ENDSTOPS
      - return: x:triggered y:triggered z:open
  
  - Test BLTouch operation (Z axis)
    - > bltouch_debug command=pin_down      # pin goes down, light goes off
    - > bltouch_debug command=pin_up        # pin goes up, red light goes on
    
  - Test BLTouch Z endstop operation
    - > bltouch_debug command=pin_down
    - > bltouch_debug command=touch_mode
    - > query_probe
      - return: probe: open
    - Slightly press and hold bltouch probe so it lights up but does not fully retract and query
      - > query_probe
        - return: probe: triggered
      - > QUERY_ENDSTOPS
        - return: x:open y:open z:triggered
    - If probe blinks (probe state error)
      - > bltouch_debug command=reset        # reset probe if fault(blinking)
      - > bltouch_debug command=self_test    # pin goes down and up repeatedly, red light stays on
      
### Check Homing
  - Verify stepper motor operation (Move axis 1mm back and forth 10 times)
    - > STEPPER_BUZZ STEPPER=stepper_x
    - > STEPPER_BUZZ STEPPER=stepper_y
    - > STEPPER_BUZZ STEPPER=stepper_z
    
  - Verify direction and homeing(endstop) per axis
    - Home X axis
      - > G28 x
    - Home Y axis
      - > G28 y
    - Home Z axis (Probe should drop first then bed will start moving)
      - > G28 z
  
### Calibrate Z offset
  - > probe_calibrate
    - Adjust z-offset (Peice of paper just dragging between nozzle and bed)
      - > testz=-0.1
      - > testz=+0.1
    - When happy with adjustment enter accept command in console
      - > accept
    
  - Verify accuracy of Z offset
    - > probe_accuracy
      - 0.0125 or better, 0.025 no worse
      - return: standard deviation of 0.002077
      
### Check extruder operation (direction) (no filament)
  - Set E to relative
    - > M83
  - Extrude 100mm
    - > G1 E100 F100
  - Retract 100mm
    - > G1 E-100 F100
    
### Perform PID tuning for heated bed and hotend (feed in filament so hotend is not empty for test)
  - > PID_CALIBRATE HEATER=heater_bed TARGET=60
    - return: PID parameters: pid_Kp=74.515 pid_Ki=1.153 pid_Kd=1204.353
    
  - > PID_CALIBRATE HEATER=extruder TARGET=200
    - return: PID parameters: pid_Kp=21.862 pid_Ki=1.139 pid_Kd=104.939
    
  - When PID tuning complete save
    - > save_config
    
### Calibrate Extruder (Calibrate e-steps) (Klipper: rotation_distance)
  - [Method_1] Obtaining rotation_distance from steps_per_mm (e-steps)(approximation)
    - Retrieve e-steps from firmware (Marlin) before flashing microcontroller with Klipper
      - > M503
        - return: M92 X200.00 Y200.00 Z400.00 E140.00
        - 140 e-steps
    - Calculate rotation distance
      - rotation_distance = <full_steps_per_rotation> * <microsteps> / <steps_per_mm>
        - 1.8 degree motor (full rotation = 200 steps (360/1.8=200))
        - 16 microsteps
        - 200 * 16 / 140 = 22.857
      - rotation_distance = 22.857mm
  
  - [Method_2] Obtaining rotation_distance from measure and trim
    - Heat extruder to 210C with filament
    - Mark Filament at 100mm from intake to extruder
    - Mark Filament at 120mm from intake to extruder
    - Extrude 100mm filament (low speed minimul pressure in extruder)
      - Set Extruder relative
        - > G91
      - Extrude 100mm
        - > G1 E100 F100
    - Measure remaining distance to mark (120mm mark to beginning of extruder)
      - Remaining Measurement = 23mm
    - actual_extrude_distance = <initial_mark_distance> - <subsequent_mark_distance>
      - 120 - 23 = 97mm
    - Previous e-steps
      - 140 e-steps / 100mm = 1.4 step per mm
    - Current e-steps
      - Actual length extruded = 120mm – (Length from the extruder to mark after extruding)
        - 120mm - 23mm = 97mm
      - Accurate steps/mm = (Old steps/mm × Actual length extruded)
        - 1.4steps/mm * 97mm = 135.8steps/mm
    - New rotation_distance for Klipper
      - rotation_distance = <full_steps_per_rotation> * <microsteps> / <steps_per_mm>
        - 200steps * (16microsteps / 135.8steps/mm) = 23.564mm
        
### Calibrate flow rate (specific to each filament)
  - PrusaSlicer (extrusion multiplier)
  - Create/download a flow rate calibration model (50mm solid cube) and slice
    - Slicer print settings:
      - Layer Height: 0.2mm (or set to your normal printer layer height)
        - PrusaSlicer > print settings > layers and perimeters > Layer height
      -Line Width: 0.4 (wall thickness)
        - PrusaSlicer > print settings > advanced > default extrusion width
      -Wall Count(Perimeters): 1
        - PrusaSlicer > print settings > layers and perimeters > Perimeters
      -Infill Density: Set to 0%
      -Top layers: set to 0 to make cube hollow
        - PrusaSlicer > print settings > layers and perimeters > Solid layers > Top
      -Print Speed: Set to your normal wall printing speed
        - PrusaSlicer > print settings > layers and perimeters > Perimeters (default 40mm/s)
    - Slicer filament settings
      - PrusaSlicer Generic PLA
        - Nozzle, First Layer:210C, Other Layers:205C
        - Bed,    First Layer:60C,  Other Layers:60C

  - Print Model with settings above
  
  - Measure each wall thickness at center on print with calipers
    - measurements: 0.36, 0.4, 0.39, 0.35
    - 0.36 + 0.4 + 0.39 + 0.35 = 1.5mm
    - 1.5 / 4 = 0.375mm average wall thickness
    
  - Calculate flow rate
    - New flow rate (%) = (0.4 ÷ average wall width) × 100
    - (0.4 / 0.375) * 100 = 106.667%
    - Extrusion Multiplier: 106.667% = 1.07
  
  - Update PrusaSlicer Extrusion Multiplier (recommended range: 0.9-1.1)
    - Filament Settings > Filament > Extrusion multiplier = 1.07
