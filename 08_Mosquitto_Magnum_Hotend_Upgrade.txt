Hotend Blower Fans (EFC-04D24L) 
  - Yellow = positive, Blue = negative
  - replaced stock fans due to fault on one.

Lgx Lite Extruder
Connector: JST-XH 4-pin connector
Motor gear : 10 teeth
Motor length: 20 mm
Motor Diameter: 36mm
Step Angle : 1.8 degree (200 steps per rotation)
Max Torque at : 1800 PPS
Max operating Temperature / Current : 120â„ƒ / 750 mA
Manufacturer : LDO
Manufacturer SKU : LDO-36STH20-1004AHG(XH)
retraction speed : 35 mm/s
retraction distance (bowden) : ~5 mm (0.4 + tube length[mm] x 0.015)
retraction distance (direct drive) for rigid materials : 0.4 mm
retraction distance (direct drive) for soft materials : 3 mm


Change of stepper motor will require adjustment of Vref for extruder
- Formula for TMC stepper drivers is Vref = ( I * 2.5 ) / Imax
  I is the target current value measured in Amps 
  Imax is 1.77 on regular mode and 1.2 on SilentStepSticks mode
- Bondtech recommended vref of between .45 - .65

min vref (0.45 * 2.5) / 1.77 = 0.64
max vref (0.65 * 2.5) / 1.77 = 0.92
vref between 0.67v - 0.92v

(0.55 * 2.5) / 1.77 = 0.78v

Update Klipper Config to suit Lgx Lite Extruder
e-steps value : 562 using 16 microsteps; 1124 using 32 microsteps. 
rotation_distance = full_steps_per_rotation * microsteps / steps_per_mm
rotation_distance = 200 * 16 / 562
rotation_distance = 5.7
